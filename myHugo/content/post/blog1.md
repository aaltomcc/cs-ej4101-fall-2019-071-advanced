- DevOps is quite popular buzzword which is used quite often with cloud technology and big data analytics. With my company is moving into delivering analytic based service solutions , which are developed in cloud environment , it seems a must to learn what is devOps to start with. Specially  using waterfall methods for services devdelopment for many years where there is clear requirment defintions and quality check before deployment , it has been question on how to gurantee quality with agile development methods. So I thought this course would give me knowledge of what DevOPs actually mean & how it is implemented.
