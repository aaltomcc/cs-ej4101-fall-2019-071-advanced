I have seen changes in mobile network from GSM , WCDMA, LTE now into 5G. Eventohugh , all those network elements which are part of mobile network are loaded with some kind of software , I have not been given opportunity niether challenge , how this software is developed.
With the advancement of computor technnologies , virtualization & big data , software development methods & analytic software solutions has become new interests in telecommunication field. That is why I thought of start learnining new skills on software developpment and data science. Introduction to Dev Ops is naturally best fitting course to start my journey to software development learnning.
